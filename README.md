FDL-CodeAgents
Semantically-optimized agents based on the OpenAI API with minimal resource consumption and FDL logic.
________________________________________
Project
FDL-CodeAgents is an AI agent architecture that applies Formal-Dialectical Logic (FDL) to process user queries, minimize API calls, and increase semantic density of responses.
This approach combines:
•	Phase logic of query resolution (initiation → unfolding → synthesis)
•	Resonant delivery of meaning, not tokens
•	Optimized GPT API usage with 60–80% reduction in costs
________________________________________
Why It Matters
Current LLM-based applications operate linearly, triggering excessive token usage, repeated clarifications, and duplicate API calls. This leads to:
•	Overspending on API usage
•	Excessive computational overhead
•	Logically incomplete or fragmented responses
The FDL approach introduces a new kind of agent, which:
•	Interprets queries through the FDL structure (thesis, flow, synthesis)
•	Produces a single, logically complete response
•	Reduces the number of iterations and calls
•	Increases coherence and depth of output

Core Modules
•	fdl_compiler.py — transforms user input into a phase-logic structure using FDL
•	agent_core.py — builds meaning-rich responses via phase resonance
•	api_wrapper.py — GPT API wrapper with intelligent routing and token compression
•	benchmark_tests/ — performance testing and token usage comparison: GPT vs FDL
•	examples/ — practical scenarios: analysis, ethics, history, politics, technology
•	docs/manifest.md — project philosophy and structural principles

Project Goals
•	Reduce GPT API usage costs via FDL logic
•	Demonstrate new paradigms of reasoning and LLM interaction
•	Prepare infrastructure for future integration with quantum and phase-based networks
