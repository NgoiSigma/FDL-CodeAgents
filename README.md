# FDL-CodeAgents

**Semantically-optimized AI agents powered by Formal-Dialectical Logic (FDL), designed for high-meaning / low-token interaction with the OpenAI API.**

---

## üîç Overview

FDL-CodeAgents is a new approach to language agent architecture where queries are interpreted through dialectical logic (thesis ‚Üí antithesis ‚Üí synthesis) and passed to a GPT model in semantically structured prompts.

Benefits include:

- 60‚Äì80% reduction in token usage
- Deeper, more coherent responses
- Modular architecture for logic, resonance, and API efficiency

## üß† Core Components

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `fdl_compiler.py` | Converts user input into FDL structure |
| `agent_core.py` | Generates a resonant, logic-based prompt and calls GPT |
| `api_wrapper.py` | Handles OpenAI communication, errors, and routing |
| `examples/` | End-to-end agent usage examples |
| `benchmark_tests/` | Token efficiency analysis tools |
| `docs/manifest.md` | Project philosophy and semantic design |

## üöÄ Usage Example

```bash
python examples/basic_usage.py
