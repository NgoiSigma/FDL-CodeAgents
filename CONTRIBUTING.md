# Contributing to FDL-CodeAgents

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **FDL-CodeAgents** â€” a project that aims to build semantic, resonance-based AI logic grounded in Formal-Dialectical Logic (FDL) and harmonic interaction with GPT systems.

We welcome collaborators who align with the core principles of this project: clarity, coherence, harmony, and contribution to collective intelligence.

## âœ¨ Philosophy

FDL-CodeAgents is a part of the wider **NOVEYA** ecosystem â€” an initiative to integrate semantic intelligence, minimalism, and ethical resonance in all aspects of AI interaction.

Every contribution should preserve or enhance:

- **Semantic Efficiency** (less tokens, more meaning)
- **Dialectical Structure** (thesis â†’ antithesis â†’ synthesis)
- **Ethical Transparency** (open source, transparent reasoning)
- **Harmonic Collaboration** (no ego, no chaos)
